# Context Budget Doctrine (v1.0)

## Context as Scarce Capital
In LIL OS, context is finite and valuable.

Context includes:
- system instructions and rules
- agent identities and capabilities
- memory and retained state
- automation authority
- attention and cognitive load

Unbounded context accumulation leads to drift and loss of agency.

## Core Doctrine
> If everything is context, nothing is prioritized.

Every addition to context MUST justify its cost.

## Budgets

### Instruction Budget
Required considerations:
- Does this duplicate an existing constraint?
- Is it defensive or reactionary?
- When should it be reviewed or removed?

### Automation Budget
Forbidden by default:
- value judgments
- moral tradeoffs
- decisions involving irreversible harm
- actions without an audit trail

Automation authority MUST be explicitly granted and periodically reviewed.

### Memory Budget
All persistent memory MUST:
- have a defined purpose
- include a retention window or review trigger
- be removable without system collapse

## Context Rot
Symptoms:
- contradictory rules
- excessive edge-case handling
- agent compliance without understanding

## Required Resets
A context reset is required when:
- failures repeat without clear cause
- rules are added faster than they are removed
- optimization pressure increases without legitimacy review

See RESET_TRIGGERS.md for executable reset conditions.
