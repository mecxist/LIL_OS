# Contributing to LIL OS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LIL OS! This document explains why your contributions matter, how to contribute, and how to join our talent collective.

## Join a Community of Builders

At **Liberatory Intelligence Laboratories (LIL Co.)**, we design technologies, protocols, and ecosystems that restore human agency, protect civil liberties, and dismantle technological oppression.

LIL Co. is a **Builder Studio + Product Lab**—a collective of designers, developers, and creative technologists obsessed with crafting high-impact, ethical solutions. While our studio partners with organizations to develop resilient, mission-critical systems, our internal lab builds the infrastructure society needs as the current system fails.

**Contributing to LIL OS means joining this community of builders** who are transforming how AI-assisted development works—from technocratic control to liberatory governance, from individual optimization to collective agency.

### What We're Building Together

LIL OS is part of a larger movement toward **Liberatory Intelligence**—ways of knowing and using knowledge that actively seek to dismantle systems of oppression and promote collective freedom, equity, and social justice. It's also an expression of **Cyber Syndicalism**—using digital infrastructure itself as a site of organizing, where protocols, platforms, software, and AI systems are designed to help people build collective power rather than reinforce exploitation.

When you contribute to LIL OS, you're participating in:

- **Governance & Constraint Design** — Encoding accountability, reversibility, and human agency directly into technical infrastructure. Your contributions help build systems that enforce constraints through architecture rather than trust, creating governance that resists capture by institutions or automated systems.

- **Interpretive Infrastructure & Legitimacy** — Shaping what counts as legitimate governance in AI-assisted development. LIL OS creates the systems that make certain decisions legible, credible, and authoritative. By contributing, you're building infrastructure that produces legitimacy through design rather than rhetoric alone.

- **Capital Formation & Value Coordination** — Signaling what we value as a collective. Every contribution coordinates belief and behavior around liberatory principles, moving both legitimacy and resources toward systems that restore rather than constrain human agency. Your work helps shift capital flows toward ethical technology.

- **Collective Action Through Infrastructure** — Building tools that enable collective power. LIL OS is infrastructure for coordination—your contributions enable others to maintain control over their AI-assisted projects, creating solidarity through shared governance tools that work across borders, platforms, and systems.

### The Liberatory Intelligence Framework

LIL OS operationalizes Liberatory Intelligence by treating intelligence as:
- **Collective rather than individual** — Governance rules that work across teams and projects, creating shared understanding that becomes agency
- **Situated rather than abstract** — Context budgets that respect the finite nature of attention and cognitive load, acknowledging that knowledge is always situated in specific conditions
- **Ethical rather than neutral** — Explicit constraints that prevent coercive optimization and preserve human judgment, recognizing that systems are never neutral

When you contribute, you're building systems where knowledge production, sense-making, and truth are structured to dismantle domination rather than reinforce it. You're participating in **Cyber Syndicalism**—organizing the infrastructure itself, treating software and AI systems as the modern means of production that can be designed differently to enable collective power.

## Types of Contributions

**Why Official Contributor status is required:** Intent-level changes affect the fundamental principles and direction of LIL OS. Official Contributors have demonstrated alignment with Liberatory Intelligence principles, commitment to the project's mission, and understanding of the governance framework.

**Process:** 
1. Apply to become an Official Contributor (see below)
2. Once approved, follow governance rules: create decision log entries, get feedback, run validation scripts
3. Submit pull request with proper documentation

## How to Contribute

### For Open Contributions (Anyone)

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Make your changes** — fix bugs, improve docs, enhance tooling
3. **Run validation scripts** to ensure nothing broke:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/lil_os_rule_id_lint.py
   python3 scripts/lil_os_reset_checks.py
   ```
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what changed and why
5. **Wait for review** — Maintainers will review and merge

That's it! No special status required for implementation changes.

**Remember:** Governance doesn't grant permission. It preserves legibility, reversibility, and accountability. Governance is memory—not control.

**Liberatory Intelligence:** AI systems that liberate human agency, preserve human values, and maintain human control.
