# LIL OS² ML User Research Framework

## Research Objectives

**Primary Question:** Is ML-enhanced governance worth building?

**Key Questions:**
1. Do developers experience governance issues with AI assistants?
2. Would ML-powered detection be valuable?
3. What are the main pain points?
4. What features are most important?

## Target Users
