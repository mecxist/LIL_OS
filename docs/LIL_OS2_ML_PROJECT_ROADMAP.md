# LIL OS² ML Project Roadmap

**Project:** LIL OS² ML GA/v1  
**Timeline:** 15 days (Pre-MVP to GA/v1)  
**Goal:** Achieve and open source release of LIL OS² + ML to general availability

## Project Overview

LIL OS² ML consists of:
- **LIL OS²**: Evolution of LIL OS v0.1.1 to v2.0 with enhanced governance, improved validation, and expanded features
- **ML Module**: Machine learning-powered features for semantic analysis, pattern detection, and predictive governance

## Milestone Structure

### Phase 0: Pre-MVP (Days 1-2)

- [LIL-159] Phase 0: Competitive Analysis ✅ Done
- [LIL-160] Phase 0: ML Module Requirements ✅ Done
- [LIL-161] Phase 0: Architecture Planning ✅ Done
- [LIL-162] Phase 0: Prototype/Mockups

**Success Criteria:**
- Value proposition validated
- User research completed
- Competitive analysis done

**Documentation Created:**
- `docs/LIL_OS2_ML_VALUE_PROPOSITION.md`
- `docs/LIL_OS2_ML_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `docs/LIL_OS2_ML_ARCHITECTURE.md`
